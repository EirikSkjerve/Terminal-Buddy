# Terminal Buddy
A simple project in Rust to learn the language, and to create a working buddy who lives in a terminal instance.
### Ideas:
- Process user input 
- More animations for buddy
- Buddy's stats (bored, sleepy etc.) changes so you have to do actions to keep buddy happy
- Enabling actions to change buddys stats
- Store buddy's state in a file so that buddy stays the same after closing and reopening buddy program
- Buddy processes input from user and can respond with semi-intelligent answers based on pre-filled quotes
- Buddy can take orders and do terminal commands for you
- API connector to a conversational chatbot (probably not)
